## Rule Changes
| Rule                           | Details                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Non-Random Starter             | You can pick the Pokemon after looking at the options.                                                                                  |
| Limited Lab Legendaries        | You can pick legendaries under 600 BST in the lab.                                                                                      |
| Limited Lab Pseudos            | You can pick psuedo-legendaries that have a 4x weakness in the lab.                                                                     |
| No Favourites Clause           | Since you can pick the above in the lab, the favourite clause is no longer in effect.                                                   |
| Gym Leader TMs                 | Gym Leader TMs are now 100% learnable.                                                                                                  |
| Catch Rates                    | Minimum Catch Rate is Set to level 5, which means the catches are guaranteed.                                                           |
| Additional Trainer Pokemon     | Boss Trainers now have 4 additonal Pokemon and Important Trainers - 2 extra mons.                                                       |
| HM moves in battle             | You may now use HM moves in battle but only if they are in your Pokemon's learnset. This is possible thanks to rando fork's setting.    |
| Highest level wilds (optional) | You can turn on the rand fork's setting to 'Force Highest Level Encounters' (Misc. Tweaks) if you want. This is purely optional.        |
| Speed Up Friendship            | Setting that increases base friendship to 215.                                                                                          |
| Rebalance Encounters (optional)| You can use a rando fork's setting to 'Rebalance Encounters'. This is optional.                                                         |
| Other Misc. Tweaks (optional)  | These are optional, but recommended: 'Revert Bad Berries', 'Fix Mythical Pokemon Experience', 'Lock Imposter to Ditto', 'Balance Static Pokemon Levels', 'Ban Unown From Wild'. Might be more worth considering that are game-specific :) |
