# Soft Kaizo IronMON

Base for the rules is [Kaizo IronMON](http://ironmon.gg)

The settings for this run require using a fork of the randomizer - [Something-Smart's Randomizer](https://github.com/something-smart/ironmon-randomizer)

## Rule Changes
| Rule                           | Details                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Non-Random Starter             | You can pick the Pokemon after looking at all the options                                                                               |
| Limited Lab Legendaries        | You can pick legendaries under 600 BST in the lab                                                                                       |
| Limited Pseudos                | You can pick pseudo-legendaries that have a 4x weakness in the lab and catch them in the wild                                           |
| No Favourites Clause           | Since you can pick the above in the lab, the favourite clause is no longer in effect                                                    |
| Catch Rates                    | Minimum Catch Rate is set to level 5, which means the catches are guaranteed                                                            |
| Speed Up Friendship            | Setting that increases base friendship to 215. You might also use in-game NPCs that increase friendship instead if you like             |
| Pivoting Everywhere            | You can re-enter or enter prematurely any dungeon if it's ONLY for pivoting purposes. You can't fight any trainers or pick up any items if you do that until you go back to where you were before entering that dungeon. That means you can go through cave tunnels to reach another area with pivots but cannot pick up items or fight trainers there yet |
| All TMs learnable              | All TMs are learnable 100%, but some rules still apply as to which ones you can use                                                     |
| Pure/Huge Power Usage          | You might use Pure Power or Huge Power if your Pokemon is 425 BST or lower                                                              |
| Additional Trainer Pokemon     | Boss Trainers now have 4 additonal Pokemon and Important Trainers - 2 extra mons                                                        |
| Stoners+                       | Any Pokemon that is normally evolved from using an evolution stone (like Arcanine, Nidoking, etc.) can now learn 1 non gym leader TM of your choice. After teaching the TM you cannot use any non gym leader TMs on that Pokemon. This refers to TMs that you pick up from the ground, receive from other NPCs or acquire with your Pickup ability. TMs that you can buy are off limits |
| Gym Leader TMs                 | Gym Leader TMs are now 100% learnable and those are the only ones you can teach unless your Pokemon falls under the Stoners+ rule       |
| Perish Song Counterplay        | You can switch out to your HM friend if you're affected by Perish Song, but then you have to immediately switch back                    |
| HM Friends Limits              | You can have up to a maximum of 2 HM friends with you in the party for the whole run and you can catch them as soon as you beat the first rival fight. If they die in double/triple/rotation battles, due to Perish Song counterplays or other situations, you cannot revive them with items. Keep that in mind if you're in a dungeon with a double battle for example |
| Switch-out Moves Sanity        | Attacking moves that switch the user out like U-turn or Volt Switch (so no Baton Pass) can now be used when you have your HM friends with you, but only if no volatile negative effects or no negative stat changes are on your main Pokemon. This includes confusion, infatuation, leech seed, perish song and all similar negative effects that go away when you switch out |
| HM Moves in Battle             | You may now use HM moves in battle but only if they are in your Pokemon's learnset. This is possible thanks to rando fork's setting. If you choose to delete that HM move you cannot relearn it |
| Banned Moves in Dungeons       | You can now use a banned move, but only once per dungeon (exactly one use of a move). You cannot use it in the overworld. This limit resets if you get a forced heal inside a dungeon. Healing with pp restoring items or other means doesn't reset the limit |

## Minor or Optional Rule Changes/Settings
| Rule                           | Details                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Highest level wilds (optional) | You can turn on the randomizer fork's setting to 'Force Highest Level Encounters' (Misc. Tweaks) if you want. This is purely optional   |
| Rebalance Encounters (optional)| You can use a rando fork's setting to 'Rebalance Encounters'. This is optional                                                          |
| Other Misc. Tweaks (optional)  | These are optional, but recommended: 'Revert Bad Berries', 'Fix Mythical Pokemon Experience', 'Lock Imposter to Ditto', 'Balance Static Pokemon Levels', 'Ban Unown From Wild'. Might be more worth considering that are game-specific. Some of these might not be available in certain games |
