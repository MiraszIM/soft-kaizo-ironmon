# Soft Kaizo IronMON

Base for the rules is [Kaizo IronMON](http://ironmon.gg)

The settings for this run require using a fork of the randomizer - [Something_Smart's Randomizer](https://github.com/something-smart/ironmon-randomizer)

## Rule Changes
| Rule                           | Details                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Non-Random Starter             | You can pick the Pokemon after looking at the options                                                                                   |
| Limited Lab Legendaries        | You can pick legendaries under 600 BST in the lab                                                                                       |
| Limited Lab Pseudos            | You can pick pseudo-legendaries that have a 4x weakness in the lab                                                                      |
| No Favourites Clause           | Since you can pick the above in the lab, the favourite clause is no longer in effect                                                    |
| Pivoting Everywhere            | You can re-enter or enter prematurely any dungeon if it's ONLY for pivoting purposes. You can't fight any trainers or pick up any items if you do that until you go back to where you were. That means you can go through cave tunnels to reach another area with pivots but cannot pick up items there yet |
| Stoners+                       | Any Pokemon that normally evolves from using a stone can now learn 1 non gym leader TM of your choice. After teaching the TM you cannot use any non gym leader TMs on that Pokemon |
| Gym Leader TMs                 | Gym Leader TMs are now 100% learnable. Also full TM compatibility for Stoners+ rule                                                     |
| Catch Rates                    | Minimum Catch Rate is Set to level 5, which means the catches are guaranteed                                                            |
| Additional Trainer Pokemon     | Boss Trainers now have 4 additonal Pokemon and Important Trainers - 2 extra mons                                                        |
| HM Moves in Battle             | You may now use HM moves in battle but only if they are in your Pokemon's learnset. This is possible thanks to rando fork's setting     |
| Highest level wilds (optional) | You can turn on the rand fork's setting to 'Force Highest Level Encounters' (Misc. Tweaks) if you want. This is purely optional         |
| Speed Up Friendship            | Setting that increases base friendship to 215                                                                                           |
| Rebalance Encounters (optional)| You can use a rando fork's setting to 'Rebalance Encounters'. This is optional                                                          |
| Other Misc. Tweaks (optional)  | These are optional, but recommended: 'Revert Bad Berries', 'Fix Mythical Pokemon Experience', 'Lock Imposter to Ditto', 'Balance Static Pokemon Levels', 'Ban Unown From Wild'. Might be more worth considering that are game-specific :) |
