# Soft Kaizo IronMON

This ruleset's goal is to:
- Make the early game much more tolerable
- Make the endgame more interesting
- Improve pivoting by trying to increase the amount and quality of pivot options, the spots in the run that have viable pivots and make the catching and running process easier and less deadly
- Introduce a Perish Song counterplay possibility
- Eliminate the need to juggle HM Friends to and from the PC
- Other minor improvements and Quality of Life changes

Warning: Expect many rules and more complex setup.

Base for the rules is [Kaizo IronMON](http://ironmon.gg)

The settings for this run require using a fork of the randomizer - [Something-Smart's Randomizer](https://github.com/something-smart/ironmon-randomizer)

### General
| Rule                           | Details                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Kaizo Baseline                 | Base for the rules is the official Kaizo IronMON ruleset. That means all the rules from Standard, Ultimate and Kaizo sections of that ruleset are in effect unless they're changed by a rule from the higher difficulty set or from the following set of rules for Soft Kaizo |
### Your Pokemon
| Rule                           | Details                                                                                                                                 |

| Non-Random Starter             | You can pick the Pokemon after looking at all the options                                                                               |
| Limited Lab Legendaries        | You can pick legendaries under 600 BST in the lab                                                                                       |
| Limited Pseudos                | You can pick pseudo-legendaries that have a 4x weakness in the lab and catch them in the wild. If they have an ability that helps with that 4x weakness (Color Change excluded), then you can only use them in the lab fight(s) and afterwards you have to pivot to another Pokemon |
| No Favourites Clause           | Since you can pick the above in the lab, the favourite clause is no longer in effect                                                    |
| HM Friends Limits              | You can have up to a maximum of 2 HM friends with you in the party for the whole run and you can catch them as soon as you get out of the Lab. If they die in double/triple/rotation battles, due to Perish Song counterplays (see Perish Song Counterplay Rule) or other situations, you cannot revive them with items. Keep that in mind if you're in a dungeon with a double battle for example |
| No Boxing of HM Friends        | You are not allowed to box your current HM Friends. If you wish to replace one, you can box it after catching a new one                 |
| Speed Up Friendship            | Setting that increases base friendship to 215. You might also use in-game NPCs that increase friendship instead if you like             |
| After-lab Boost                | See First: 'Free Lab' and 'Match Coverage Guy' rules. After the lab fight(s) you are allowed to grind up your starter or any pivot to match first mandatory trainer's ace level before you pivot or fight any trainers. After beating the first trainer (either mandatory or optional) you can no longer gain any experience from Wild Pokemon |
### Trainer Pokemon

| Ensure Champion 100s           | Trainer Pokemon level increase might be higher than 50% to ensure the final boss of the challenge has all level 100s if he/she doesn't yet. It needs to be the minimal amount needed to reach that. This requires to have the 'Double % Increase' setting checked. Please refer to Game Specific Information section below to learn the exact values |
| Delay Fully-evolved            | Level for guaranteed fully-evolved Pokemon appearance on trainers might be delayed so that the 2nd Gym leader has a chance to have not fully-evolved Pokemon. Please refer to Game Specific Information section below to learn the exact level |
### Catching / Pivoting
| Rule                           | Details                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Catch Rates                    | Minimum Catch Rate is set to level 5, which means the catches are guaranteed                                                            |
| Maximum Total Level Upgrade    | You can now pivot up a total of 4 levels but only cumulatively across the entire run. Pivoting down levels doesn't affect the total     |
| Rebalance Encounters (optional)| You can use a rando fork's setting to 'Rebalance Encounters'. This is optional, but recommended                                         |
| No Limit Per Route             | The limit of catches per route is no longer in effect, but you can only catch 1 Pokemon of each species throughout the run              |
| Match Coverage Guy             | (TO BE TESTED) Wild Pokemon levels are further increased to elevate "after Lab" pivots against the first mandatory trainer's ace after the lab. This requires to have the 'Double % Increase' setting checked. Please refer to Game Specific Information section below to confirm the exact values |
| More Pivots                    | You can re-enter or enter prematurely any dungeon if it's ONLY for pivoting purposes. You can't fight any trainers or pick up any items there if you do that |
### Moves
| Rule                           | Details                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All TMs learnable              | All TMs are learnable 100%, but some rules still apply as to which ones you can use                                                     |
| Gym Leader TMs                 | Gym Leader TMs are now 100% learnable and those are the only ones you can teach unless there is an exception from any other rules (like Stoners+, Wild Scouting, Remember Old Moves etc.)  |
| Stoners+                       | Any Pokemon that is normally evolved from using an evolution stone (like Arcanine, Nidoking, etc.) can now learn 1 non gym leader TM OR a move tutor move of your choice. After learning the move you cannot use any non gym leader TMs or move tutors on that Pokemon |
| Remember Old Moves             | You can relearn a move that you previously had, but deleted, by using a TM (except Sketch) - this rule doesn't apply to Gens which make the TMs infinite use |
| HM Moves in Battle             | You may now use HM moves in battle but only if they are in your Pokemon's learnset. This is possible thanks to rando fork's setting. If you choose to delete that HM move you cannot relearn it |
| HM Moves Outside of Battle     | Considering you can now have an HM move in your learnset, you are not allowed to use it outside of battle until you acquire a corresponding HM item |
| Legal Drain Moves              | Drain moves - meaning attacking moves that deal damage and heal the user based on Atk/SpAtk and damage done - are now legal to use everywhere. These are for example Drain Punch, Giga Drain, Leech Life. So not Leech Seed, Pain Split, Endeavor, etc. |
| Banned Moves in Dungeons       | You can now use a banned move that your Pokemon learned by level-up or from a legal TM, but only once per dungeon (exactly one use of a move). You cannot use it in the overworld. This limit resets if you get a forced heal inside a dungeon. Healing with pp restoring items or other means doesn't reset the limit |
| Wild Scouting                  | You are allowed to learn any TM move that would make Wild scouting safe, but you are not allowed to use that move in trainer battles.   |
| Beat Up Shedinja               | You may use Beat Up but only as a Shedinja coverage move                                                                                |

## Game Specific Information
Extra Information about the general rules above, but game-specific. The rule names below match the rule names that are present above.

### Pokemon Platinum
| Rule                           | Value                | Details                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ensure Champion 100s           | Foe Pokemon **36%**  | Cynthia's lowest level is 58 in the original. With 72% increase it makes all her Pokemon to be level 100 (99.76 rounded up). That means with the 'Double % Increase' setting the increase is 36% for Foe Pokemon |
| Match Coverage Guy             | Wild Pokemon **50%** | Highest level wild that could be acquired before the first mandatory trainer on Route 202 (Ace level 9) has level 4 in the original and 6 in standard IronMON. Due to extra trainer level increase we need to get as close to level 9 as possible - maximum possible is level 8 with 100% increase. That means with the 'Double % Increase' setting the increase is 50% for Wild Pokemon |
| Delay Fully-evolved            | **To Lvl 35.**       | Due to the further trainer Pokemon level increase, lowest level of Gardenia's Pokemon will be 34. That means guaranteed fully-evolved Pokemon appearance level setting should be set to 35 |
